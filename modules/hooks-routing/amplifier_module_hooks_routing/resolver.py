    Two refinements over pure lexicographic sort:

    1. **Date-suffix stripping.** A trailing ``-YYYYMMDD`` or ``-YYYY-MM-DD``
       is removed before sorting. This ensures clean-versioned IDs like
       ``claude-opus-4-7`` sort above snapshot IDs like
       ``claude-opus-4-20250514`` (which is actually Opus 4.0, not 4.2 billion).

    2. **Numeric-aware splitting.** Digit runs are compared as integers so
       ``claude-opus-4-10`` > ``claude-opus-4-7`` (the string sort would pick
       ``4-7`` because ``'7' > '1'`` lexicographically).

    Secondary key (``-len(name)``) is a tie-breaker that prefers shorter names
    when the primary key is equal — e.g. ``gpt-5.4`` wins over
    ``gpt-5.4-2026-03-05`` because aliases are preferred over pinned snapshots.

    The matrix ``provider:`` field accepts any key present in

    * **Type-name mode** (the common case): ``'anthropic'``, ``'openai'``,
      ``'gemini'``, ``'github-copilot'``. Matches the short mount name the
      provider registers itself under.
    * **Instance-ID mode** (multi-instance providers): ``'openai-internal'``,
      ``'openai-reasoning'``. Matches the ``id:`` set in ``settings.yaml`` for
      a second instance of an already-installed provider module. See
      ``docs/MATRIX_CURATOR_GUIDE.md`` for the multi-instance pattern.

    Args:
        providers: Dict of mounted providers keyed by module id or instance id.

        matrix: Composed matrix ``roles`` dict (from :mod:`matrix_loader`).
        providers: Installed providers dict from ``coordinator.get("providers")``.
        preresolved_models: Optional mutable dict of ``provider_type ->

            was already fetched (e.g. by the parent session).
            :func:`_resolve_glob` also writes newly-fetched lists back into the
            dict, so subsequent calls for the same provider within the same
            session are also free.

            **Asyncio safety:** the dict is shared across concurrently-running
            ``_resolve_one`` coroutines (via ``asyncio.gather``).  Because
            asyncio is cooperative and single-threaded, dict reads and writes
            never interleave — a coroutine only yields at explicit ``await``
            points, and dict mutation is a non-awaited operation.

    Returns:
        List of ``{provider, model, config}`` dicts representing resolved
        preferences.  Empty if no role resolves.
